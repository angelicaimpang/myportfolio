<h4 style="background-color: gray;"<center> My name is Angelica Impang from BIT-CT 3C. I was born on August 9,2001 so basically I am 21 years young. I live in General, Tudela, Cebu. 


<P></P>I am an ambiverted leo, who enjoys socialising
with people once in a while and at the same time also enjoys being alone at the comfort of my own company. I am looking for an opportunity to take up new challenges and putting in all my efforts and knowledge to cope with them efficiently. I always try to move forward in a balanced manner.
<P></P>I am taking up the course Bachelor in Industrial Technology with a Major in Computer Technology. Fortunately, I am on my 3rd year now. I pursued this course because I am interested to know more about the computer technology, since many people especially those who did not grow up immersed in technology, have trouble understanding the systems necessary for computer literacy,though not always obvious to people with an intuitive understanding of how to use computers. For Computer Literacy is a mandatory skill for success in school, the job force, and everyday life.
